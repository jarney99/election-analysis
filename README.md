# election-analysis
## Overview
We were performing an election audit for Tom over three counties in Colorado. 
### Purpose
We will be analyzing the election to find total number of votes cast, a list of candidates who received votes, total number of votes received, percentage of votes won, and the winner based on popular vote. Although normally done in excel, we can automate the process using python. Using python we were able to create a simple and easy to read result of this election.
