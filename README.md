# election-analysis
## Overview
We were performing an election audit for Tom over three counties in Colorado. 
### Purpose
We will be analyzing the election to find total number of votes cast, a list of candidates who received votes, total number of votes received, percentage of votes won, and the winner based on popular vote. Although normally done in excel, we can automate the process using python. Using python we were able to create a simple and easy to read result of this election. 
## Election-Audit results
  * There were 369,711 total votes in this election.
  * As we can see below, Jefferson had 38,855 votes total, or 10.5% of the total votes. Arapahoe had 24,801 votes, or 6.7% of the total vote. Denver had by far the     most votes with 306,055 votes, or 82.8% of the total vote. 
  * Denver had 82.8% of the total votes, so they had by far the biggest number of votes.

## Summary
This script was used to audit the election in Colorado and can be modified to audit other elections. If we were to do an election for the state of Colorado, we would just have to analye more counties. We would still be able to find out how many votes there were total in each county, and who they voted for. 
We could also see what percentage of individuals voted for each candidate from each county. We would just have to add a decision statement to our code.
